{"name":"CTAWG Data","tagline":"Find links to all the data used by CTAWG at UC Berkeley.","body":"# CTAWG Data\r\n\r\n## Why/how did we choose this data?\r\nIn the Fall of 2015 CTWAG group members decided to use one common data set through which to explore computational text analysis methods.  Members chose to focus our collective efforts on the Congressional Record.  We chose the Congressional Record for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. \"Big\" data set: There is a large amount of data.\r\n2. Publicly available data: The data is public information, so there are no copyright issues to our work.\r\n3. Multiple forms of communication: The record includes both spoken and written text communication\r\n4. External linkages: Potential to link to voter records, meta data about congress people, committees served on, etc.\r\n\r\n## What data files should I use?\r\nWe are still at the preliminary stages of scraping and pre-processing the Congressional Record from WEBSITE.  For Spring 2016 we will therefor be working with two branches of data:\r\n\r\n1. Original CTAWG data (v0.1)\r\n1. 1. \r\n1. ISPSC Data\r\n1. 1. In YEAR, NAME and NAME worked to compile and pre-process data from the XXX-XXX congress.  This data is available to researchers at universities affiliated with the ISPSC collective (including UC Berkeley).  This dataset will be used as a bridge, enabling us to work through more advanced stages of a text analysis project, while we prepare our own more exhaustive original data set using WEBSITE records. To download this data, follow the link and request access using your _berkeley.edu_ address.  Requests will be processed asap.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
